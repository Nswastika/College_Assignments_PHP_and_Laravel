                <h5>Background and Aim</h5>
                    <p> There are many students in our country who want to earn and learn at the same time. So, Job4Students was established in 2021 to provide a facility for students to find term time and holiday jobs.</p>
				<h5>Our Services</h5>
                    <p>Job 4 Students is essentially an online job board that enables employers to advertise job vacancies to thousands of job seekers via our comprehensive 
                        job search facilities. Student jobseekers use our free, comprehensive job search facilities to find 
                        suitable work in a region of their choice on dates they are available.
                        Students can create their Resume and download in pdf format. The students can message directly to the employers to make a discussion on a 
                        particular job. Successful students can share their success story.</p>
